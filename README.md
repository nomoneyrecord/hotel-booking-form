##Summary

This is the second project into our program which is meant to focus on developing active form selectors and validations for sending information. This displays more focus on styling with in style.css and less focus on styling within the index. Though some styling was used in the index, most of it was coded with in the style sheet to maintain good practice and a more structured workflow. 

This site shows very basic form features for a mock resort in Pittsburgh ranging from client information to reservation requirements for the resort. This also shows the validation results of required fields and prompts the front-end user to operate with in the form requirements.
